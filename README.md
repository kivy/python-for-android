# python-for-android

python-for-android (p4a) is a development tool that packages Python apps into
binaries that can run on Android devices.

It can generate: 

* [Android Package](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apk_(file_format)) (APK)
  files, ready to install locally on a device, especially for testing. This format
  is used by many [app stores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Android_app_stores)
  but not [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/). 
* [Android App Bundle](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle/faq) 
  (AAB) files which can be shared on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/).
* [Android Archive](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library)
  (AAR) files which can be used as a re-usable bundle of resources for other 
  projects.
 
It supports multiple CPU architectures.

It supports apps developed with [Kivy framework](http://kivy.org), but was
built to be flexible about the backend libraries (through "bootstraps"), and 
also supports [PySDL2](https://pypi.org/project/PySDL2/), and a
[WebView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView) with
a Python web server.

It automatically supports dependencies on most pure Python packages. For other
packages, including those that depend on C code, a special "recipe" must be 
written to support cross-compiling. python-for-android comes with recipes for
many of the mosty popular libraries (e.g. numpy and sqlalchemy) built in.

python-for-android works by cross-compiling the Python interpreter and its
dependencies for Android devices, and bundling it with the app's python code
and dependencies. The Python code is then interpreted on the Android device.

It is recommended that python-for-android be used via 
[Buildozer](https://buildozer.readthedocs.io/), which ensures the correct
dependencies are pre-installed, and centralizes the configuration. However, 
python-for-android is not limited to being used with Buildozer.
