Differences to the old python-for-android project
=================================================

This python-for-android project is a rewrite, and eventual
replacement, for Kivy's existing python-for-android project. This
project existed for some time and, although it is now close to
deprecated, there are many resources discussing how to use it.

For this reason, the following documentation gives a basic explanation
of how to accomplish that previously used the ``distribute.sh`` and
``build.py`` toolchain with this new one.
