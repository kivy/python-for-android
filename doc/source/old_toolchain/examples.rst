Prebuilt VirtualBox
-------------------

A good starting point to build an APK are prebuilt VirtualBox images,
where the Android NDK, the Android SDK, and the Kivy
Python-For-Android sources are prebuilt in an VirtualBox image. Please
search the `Download Section <http://kivy.org/#download>`__ for such
an image. You will also need to create a device filter for the Android
USB device using the VirtualBox OS settings.
