Old p4a toolchain doc
=====================

This is the documentation for the old python-for-android toolchain,
using distribute.sh and build.py. This it entirely superseded by the
new toolchain, you do not need to read it unless using this old
method.

.. warning:: The old toolchain is deprecated and no longer
             supported. You should instead use the :doc:`current version
             <../quickstart>`.

Python for android is a project to create your own Python distribution
including the modules you want, and create an apk including python, libs, and
your application.
