Android Python module
=====================

Python for android project include a python module named "android". This module is designed to give you an access to the Java Android API. 
As for today, the module is very limited, and waiting for contribution to wrap more Java Android API.


How to use it
-------------

Using `PyJNIus <https://github.com/kivy/pyjnius>`__ to access the Android API 
restricts the usage to a simple call of the **autoclass** constructor function
and a second call to instantiate this class.

You can access through this method all Java Android API, e.g. to get the DisplayMetrics
of an Android device could fetched using the following piece of code:

.. code-block:: python

   DisplayMetrics = autoclass('android.util.DisplayMetrics')
   metrics = DisplayMetrics()
   metrics.setToDefaults()
   self.densityDpi = metrics.densityDpi

You can access all fields and methods as described in the `Java Android
DisplayMetrics API <http://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/DisplayMetrics.html>`__
as shown here with the method `setToDefaults()` and the field `densityDpi`.
Before you use o view a field, you should always call `setToDefaults` to initiate
to the default values of the device.

Currently only JavaMethod, JavaStaticMethod, JavaField, JavaStaticField
and JavaMultipleMethod are built into PyJNIus, therefore such constructs like
registerListener or something like this have to be coded still in Java. 
For this the Android module described below is available to access some of 
the hardware in Android devices.

More background how to use the Java Android API without PyJNIus is also given
below in the chapter `how-it-s-working-without-pyjnius`_


Prebuilt VirtualBox
-------------------

A good starting point to build an APK are prebuilt VirtualBox images, where
the Android NDK, the Android SDK and the Kivy Python-For-Android sources 
are prebuilt in an VirtualBox image. Please search the `Download Section 
<http://kivy.org/#download>`__ for
such an image.

Android API
-----------

Hardware
~~~~~~~~

This module is built for accessing hardware devices of an Android device

.. module:: Hardware


.. function:: vibrate(s)

   Causes the phone to vibrate for `s` seconds. This requires that your
   application have the VIBRATE permission.


.. function:: getHardwareSensors() 

   Returns a string of all hardware sensors of an Android device where each
   line lists the informations about one sensor in the following format:

   Name=name,Vendor=vendor,Version=version,MaximumRange=maximumRange,MinDelay=minDelay,Power=power,Type=type

   For more information about this informations look into the original Java API
   for the `Sensors Class <http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Sensor.html>`__
   
.. attribute:: accelerometerSensor

   This variable links to a generic3AxisSensor instance and their functions to
   access the accelerometer sensor

.. attribute:: orientationSensor

   This variable links to a generic3AxisSensor instance and their functions to
   access the orientation sensor

.. attribute:: magenticFieldSensor


The following two instance methods of the generic3AxisSensor class should be
used to enable/disable the sensor and to read the sensor


.. function:: changeStatus(boolean enable)

   Changes the status of the sensor, the status of the sensor is enabled,
   if `enable` is true or disabled, if `enable` is false.

.. function:: readSensor()

    Returns an (x, y, z) tuple of floats that gives the sensor reading,
    the units depend on the sensor as shown on the Java API page for `SensorEvent
    <http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorEvent.html>`_. 
    The sesnor must be enabled before this function is called. If the tuple 
    contains three zero values, the accelerometer is not enabled, not available, 
    defective, has not returned a reading, or the device is in free-fall.

.. function:: get_dpi()

    Returns the screen density in dots per inch.

.. function:: show_keyboard()

    Shows the soft keyboard.

.. function:: hide_keyboard()

    Hides the soft keyboard.

.. function:: wifi_scanner_enable()

    Enables wifi scanning. 

    .. note:: ACCESS_WIFI_STATE and CHANGE_WIFI_STATE permissions are required.

.. function:: wifi_scan()

    Returns a String for each visible WiFi access point

    (SSID, BSSID, SignalLevel) 

Action
~~~~~~

This module is built to deliver data to someone else.

.. module:: Action

.. function:: send(mimetype, filename, subject, text, chooser_title)

    Deliver data to someone else. This method is a wrapper around `ACTION_SEND
    <http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#ACTION_SEND>`_

    :Parameters:
        `mimetype`: str
            Must be a valid mimetype, that represent the content to sent.
        `filename`: str, default to None
            (optional) Name of the file to attach. Must be a absolute path.
        `subject`: str, default to None
            (optional) Default subject
        `text`: str, default to None
            (optional) Content to send.
        `chooser_title`: str, default to None
            (optional) Title of the android chooser window, default to 'Send email...'

    Sending a simple hello world text::

        android.action_send('text/plain', text='Hello world',
            subject='Test from python')

    Sharing an image file::

        # let's say you've make an image in /sdcard/image.png
        android.action_send('image/png', filename='/sdcard/image.png')

    Sharing an image with a default text too::

        android.action_send('image/png', filename='/sdcard/image.png',
            text='Hi,\n\tThis is my awesome image, what do you think about it ?')

Further Modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some further modules are currently available but not yet documented. 
Please have a look into the code and you are very welcome to contribute to 
this documentation.


Android Service
---------------

Service part of the application is controlled through the class :class:`AndroidService`.

.. module:: android

.. class:: AndroidService(title, description)

    Run ``service/main.py`` from application directory as a service.

    :Parameters:
        `title`: str, default to 'Python service'
            Notification title.

        `description`: str, default to 'Kivy Python service started'
            Notification text.

    .. method:: start(arg)

        Start the service.

            :Parameters:
                `arg`: str, default to ''
                    Argument to pass to a service,
                    through environment variable ``PYTHON_SERVICE_ARGUMENT``.

    .. method:: stop()

        Stop the service.

Application activity part example, ``main.py``:

.. code-block:: python

  from android import AndroidService

  ...

   class ServiceExample(App):

    ...

       def start_service(self):
           self.service = AndroidService('Sevice example', 'service is running')
           self.service.start('Hello From Service')

       def stop_service(self):
           self.service.stop()

Application service part example, ``service/main.py``:

.. code-block:: python

   import os
   import time

   # get the argument passed
   arg = os.getenv('PYTHON_SERVICE_ARGUMENT')

   while True:
       # this will print 'Hello From Service' continually, even when application is switched
       print arg
       time.sleep(1)


How it's working without PyJNIus
--------------------------------

The whole Android API is accessible in Java. Their is no native or extensible
way to access it from Python. The schema for accessing to their API is::

    [1] Cython -> [2] C JNI -> [3] Java

#. ``android.pyx`` is written in `Cython <http://cython.org/>`_: a language
   with typed informations, very close to Python, that generate Python
   extension. It's easier to write in Cython than CPython, and it's linked
   directly to the part 2.
#. ``android_jni.c`` is defining simple c methods that access to Java
   interfaces using JNI layer.
#. The last part contain the Java code that will be called from the JNI stuff.

All the source code is available at:

    https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/tree/master/recipes/android/src


Example without PyJNIus
-----------------------

::

    import android

    # activate the vibrator
    android.vibrate(1)

    # read screen dpi
    print android.get_dpi()


Bridges
-------

Some part of the Android API is not accessible from PyJNIus. For example, if
you want to receive some broadcast, you need to implement a `BroadcastReceiver
<http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver.html>`_.
PyJNIus allows you to implement dynamically classes from Java interfaces, but
unfortunately, the `BroadcastReceiver` is an abstract class.

So we started to create bridges for this case.

android_broadcast
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. module:: android_broadcast

.. class:: BroadcastReceiver

    Implementation of the android `BroadcastReceiver
    <http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver.html>`_.
    You can specify the callback that will receive the broadcast event, and
    actions or categories filters.

    .. warning::

        The callback will be called in another thread than the main thread. Be
        careful to not access to OpenGL or something like that.

    .. method:: __init__(callback, actions=None, categories=None)

        :param callback: function or method that will receive the event. Will
                         receive the context and intent as argument.
        :param actions: list of strings that represent an action.
        :param categories: list of strings that represent a category.

        For actions and categories, the string must be in lower case, without the prefix::

            # In java: Intent.ACTION_HEADSET_PLUG
            # In python: 'headset_plug'

    .. method:: start()

        Register the receiver with all the actions and categories, and start
        handling events.

    .. method:: stop()

        Unregister the receiver with all the actions and categories, and stop
        handling events.

Example::

    class TestApp(App):

        def build(self):
            self.br = BroadcastReceiver(
                self.on_broadcast, actions=['headset_plug'])
            self.br.start()
            # ...

        def on_broadcast(self, context, intent):
            extras = intent.getExtras()
            headset_state = bool(extras.get('state'))
            if headset_state:
                print 'The headset is plugged'
            else:
                print 'The headset is unplugged'

        # don't forget to stop and restart the receiver when the app is going
        # to pause / resume mode

        def on_pause(self):
            self.br.stop()
            return True

        def on_resume(self):
            self.br.start()


Old Version
-----------

.. note::

   The following is from an older version and the documentation for this
   part is currently not updated. Nevertheless it is included here for history
   and further development aspects.


android
~~~~~~~

.. module:: android

.. function:: check_pause()

    This should be called on a regular basis to check to see if Android
    expects the game to pause. If it return true, the game should call
    :func:`android.wait_for_resume()`, after persisting its state as necessary.

.. function:: wait_for_resume()

    This function should be called after :func:`android.check_pause()` returns
    true. It does not return until Android has resumed from the pause. While in
    this function, Android may kill a game without further notice.

.. function:: map_key(keycode, keysym)

    This maps between an android keycode and a python keysym. The android
    keycodes are available as constants in the android module.



android_mixer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. module:: android_mixer

The android_mixer module contains a subset of the functionality in found
in the `pygame.mixer <http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mixer.html>`_ module. It's
intended to be imported as an alternative to pygame.mixer, using code like: ::

   try:
       import pygame.mixer as mixer
   except ImportError:
       import android_mixer as mixer

Note that if you're using `kivy.core.audio
<http://kivy.org/docs/api-kivy.core.audio.html>`_ module, you don't have to do
anything, all is automatic.

The android_mixer module is a wrapper around the Android MediaPlayer
class. This allows it to take advantage of any hardware acceleration
present, and also eliminates the need to ship codecs as part of an
application.

It has several differences from the pygame mixer:

* The init and pre_init methods work, but are ignored - Android chooses
  appropriate setting automatically.

* Only filenames and true file objects can be used - file-like objects
  will probably not work.

* Fadeout does not work - it causes a stop to occur.

* Looping is all or nothing, there's no way to choose the number of
  loops that occur. For looping to work, the
  :func:`android_mixer.periodic` function should be called on a
  regular basis.

* Volume control is ignored.

* End events are not implemented.

* The mixer.music object is a class (with static methods on it),
  rather than a module. Calling methods like :func:`mixer.music.play`
  should work.

.. note::

    The android_mixer module hasn't been tested much, and so bugs may be
    present.



android_billing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. module:: android_billing

This billing module give an access to the `In-App Billing <http://developer.android.com/guide/google/play/billing/billing_overview.html>`_:

#. `Setup a test accounts <http://developer.android.com/guide/google/play/billing/billing_admin.html#billing-testing-setup>`, and get your Public Key
#. Export your public key::

    export BILLING_PUBKEY="Your public key here"

#. `Setup some In-App product <http://developer.android.com/guide/google/play/billing/billing_admin.html>`_ to buy. Let's say you've created a product with the id "org.kivy.gopremium"

#. In your application, you can use the billing module like this::


    from android_billing import BillingService
    from kivy.clock import Clock

    class MyBillingService(object):

        def __init__(self):
            super(MyBillingService, self).__init__()

            # Start the billing service, and attach our callback
            self.service = BillingService(billing_callback)

            # Start a clock to check billing service message every seconds
            Clock.schedule_interval(self.service.check, 1)

        def billing_callback(self, action, *largs):
            '''Callback that will receive all the event from the Billing service
            '''
            if action == BillingService.BILLING_ACTION_ITEMSCHANGED:
                items = largs[0]
                if 'org.kivy.gopremium' in items:
                    print 'Congratulation, you have a premium acess'
                else:
                    print 'Unfortunately, you dont have premium access'

        def buy(self, sku):
            # Method to buy something.
            self.service.buy(sku)

        def get_purchased_items(self):
            # Return all the items purchased
            return self.service.get_purchased_items()

#. To initiate a in-app purchase, just call the buy method::

    # Note: start the service at the start, and never twice!
    bs = MyBillingService()
    bs.buy('org.kivy.gopremium')

    # Later, when you get the notification that items have been changed, you
    # can still check all the items you bought:
    print bs.get_purchased_items()
    {'org.kivy.gopremium': {'qt: 1}}

#. You'll receive all the notification about the billing process in the callback.

#. Last step, create your application with `--with-billing $BILLING_PUBKEY`::

    ./build.py ... --with-billing $BILLING_PUBKEY
