Android Python module
=====================

Python for android project include a python module named "android". This module is designed to give you an access to the Android API. As for today, the module is very limited, and waiting for contribution to wrap more Android API.

Example
-------

::

    import android

    # activate the vibrator
    android.vibrate(1)

    # read screen dpi
    print android.get_dpi()

How it's working
----------------

The whole Android API is accessible in Java. Their is no native or extensible way to access it from Python. The schema for accessing to their API is::

    [1] Cython -> [2] C JNI -> [3] Java

#. ``android.pyx`` is written in `Cython <http://cython.org/>`_: a language
   with typed informations, very close to Python, that generate Python
   extension. It's easier to write in Cython than CPython, and it's linked
   directly to the part 2.
#. ``android_jni.c`` is defining simple c methods that access to Java
   interfaces using JNI layer.
#. The last part contain the Java code that will be called from the JNI stuff.

All the source code is available at:

API

android
~~~~~~~

.. module:: android

.. function:: check_pause()

   This should be called on a regular basis to check to see if Android
   expects the game to pause. If it return true, the game should
   call :func:`android.wait_for_resume()`, after persisting its state
   as necessary.

.. function:: wait_for_resume()

   This function should be called after :func:`android.check_pause()`
   returns true. It does not return until Android has resumed from
   the pause. While in this function, Android may kill a game
   without further notice.

.. function:: map_key(keycode, keysym)

   This maps between an android keycode and a python keysym. The android
   keycodes are available as constants in the android module.

.. function:: vibrate(s)

   Causes the phone to vibrate for `s` seconds. This requires that your
   application have the VIBRATE permission.

.. function:: accelerometer_enable(enable)

   Enables (if `enable` is true) or disables the device's accelerometer.

.. function:: accelerometer_reading()

   Returns an (x, y, z) tuple of floats that gives the accelerometer
   reading, in meters per second squared. See `this page
   <http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorEvent.html>`_
   for a description of the coordinate system. The accelerometer must
   be enabled before this function is called. If the tuple contains
   three zero values, the accelerometer is not enabled, not available,
   defective, has not returned a reading, or the device is in
   free-fall.

.. function:: get_dpi()

   Returns the screen density in dots per inch.

.. function:: show_keyboard()

   Shows the soft keyboard.

.. function:: hide_keyboard()

   Hides the soft keyboard.

.. function:: wifi_scanner_enable()

   Enables wifi scanning. ACCESS_WIFI_STATE and CHANGE_WIFI_STATE permissions required.

.. function:: wifi_scan()

   Returns tuple of (SSID, BSSID, SignalLevel) for each visible WiFi access point.


android_mixer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. module:: android_mixer

The android_mixer module contains a subset of the functionality in found
in the `pygame.mixer <http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mixer.html>`_ module. It's
intended to be imported as an alternative to pygame.mixer, using code like: ::

   try:
       import pygame.mixer as mixer
   except ImportError:
       import android_mixer as mixer

Note that if you're using `kivy.core.audio
<http://kivy.org/docs/api-kivy.core.audio.html>`_ module, you don't have to do
anything, all is automatic.

The android_mixer module is a wrapper around the Android MediaPlayer
class. This allows it to take advantage of any hardware acceleration
present, and also eliminates the need to ship codecs as part of an
application.

It has several differences from the pygame mixer:

* The init and pre_init methods work, but are ignored - Android chooses
  appropriate setting automatically.

* Only filenames and true file objects can be used - file-like objects
  will probably not work.

* Fadeout does not work - it causes a stop to occur.

* Looping is all or nothing, there's no way to choose the number of
  loops that occur. For looping to work, the
  :func:`android_mixer.periodic` function should be called on a
  regular basis.

* Volume control is ignored.

* End events are not implemented.

* The mixer.music object is a class (with static methods on it),
  rather than a module. Calling methods like :func:`mixer.music.play`
  should work.

.. note::

    The android_mixer module hasn't been tested much, and so bugs may be
    present.
