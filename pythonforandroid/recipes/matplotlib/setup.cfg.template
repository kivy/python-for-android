# Rename this file to mplsetup.cfg to modify Matplotlib's build options.

[libs]
# By default, Matplotlib builds with LTO, which may be slow if you re-compile
# often, and don't need the space saving/speedup.
enable_lto = False
# By default, Matplotlib downloads and builds its own copies of FreeType and of
# Qhull.  You may set the following to True to instead link against a system
# FreeType/Qhull.  As an exception, Matplotlib defaults to the system version
# of FreeType on AIX.
system_freetype = True
#system_qhull = False

[packages]
# There are a number of data subpackages from Matplotlib that are
# considered optional. All except 'tests' data (meaning the baseline
# image files) are installed by default, but that can be changed here.
#tests = False

[gui_support]
# Matplotlib supports multiple GUI toolkits, known as backends.
# The MacOSX backend requires the Cocoa headers included with XCode.
# You can select whether to build it by uncommenting the following line.
# It is never built on Linux or Windows, regardless of the config value.
#
macosx = False

[rc_options]
# User-configurable options
#
# Default backend, one of: Agg, Cairo, GTK3Agg, GTK3Cairo, GTK4Agg, GTK4Cairo,
# MacOSX, Pdf, Ps, QtAgg, QtCairo, SVG, TkAgg, WX, WXAgg.
#
# The Agg, Ps, Pdf and SVG backends do not require external dependencies.  Do
# not choose MacOSX if you have disabled the relevant extension modules.  The
# default is determined by fallback.
#
#backend = Agg
