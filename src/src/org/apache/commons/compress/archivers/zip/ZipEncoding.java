/**
 * An interface for encoders that do a pretty encoding of ZIP
 * filenames.
 *
 * <p>There are mostly two implementations, one that uses java.nio
 * {@link java.nio.charset.Charset Charset} and one implementation,
 * which copes with simple 8 bit charsets, because java-1.4 did not
 * support Cp437 in java.nio.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The main reason for defining an own encoding layer comes from
 * the problems with {@link java.lang.String#getBytes(String)
 * String.getBytes}, which encodes unknown characters as ASCII
 * quotation marks ('?'). Quotation marks are per definition an
 * invalid filename on some operating systems  like Windows, which
 * leads to ignored ZIP entries.</p>
 * 
 * <p>All implementations should implement this interface in a
 * reentrant way.</p>
